No hard pants, no hard decisions, no hard life!
The only hard thing you're allowed today is drinks. And only if you're 21.
Take a nap! Take TWO naps!
Have a nice, warm bath.
Make sure you take time to take care of YOU today.
Put your phone on silent. You don't have to answer. Unless it's your mom... If it's your mom, you probably should.
Order a pizza instead of cooking!
Remember, no is a complete sentence. And you're allowed to use it.
This would be a good day to stay in and read. May I recommend Noodle and the No Bones day?
Don't do dishes. Don't do laundry. It'll wait.
Stay in bed all day.
Watch your favorite show from start to finish. All of it.
Make sure you have plenty of snacks on hand.
