# bonesDayPredictionGame
A game based on Noodle the pug (@showmenoodz on instagram) that predicts if it's a bones day and also takes you up comfy mountain for some pug wisdom

Need to know if you should wear hard pants or not? Looking for justification to stay in bed from a geriatric pug? 
Get your answers with the bones day predictor
Just want some doggy wisdom?
ascend Comfy Mountain and request wisdom from our sweet prince
if you choose a prediction you can also choose to get wisdom afterward
Once you've logged 7 unique days of predictions, you become a VIP (Very Important Pug) and will have access to special content! (coming soon)

This is my first fully independently written side project. It was written at the end of module 1 of Tech Elevator's part time remote Java course.
It uses almost everything we learned so far, and was a LOT of fun to write. 
I intend to add a new version at the end of each remaining module utilizing the new skills from that module to improve the result
This will help me see my progress as a developer, and also let me make better and better versions of the basic idea here
